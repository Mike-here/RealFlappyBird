# The Real Flappy Bird

The Real Flappy Bird is a 2D arcade-style game built using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, you control a bird that must navigate through obstacles (pipes) without hitting them or the ground. The objective is to fly as far as possible while scoring points by passing through the gaps between pipes.

## Features
- **Bird Animation**: The bird flaps its wings while flying, giving it a realistic movement animation.
- **Obstacle Generation**: Pipes are generated randomly and scroll across the screen. The player must navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.
- **Scrolling Background**: The ground/base scrolls continuously to create the illusion of forward movement.
- **Scoring System**: Points are awarded each time the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes.
- **Restart Functionality**: When the bird crashes into a pipe or the ground, the game can be restarted by clicking the restart button.
- **Gravity and Jumping Mechanic**: The bird is constantly affected by gravity, and clicking the mouse makes the bird jump to avoid obstacles.

## How to Play
1. Run the game:
2. Control the bird by clicking the mouse to make it flap upwards.
3. Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes without hitting them.
4. The score increases each time the bird passes through a pair of pipes.
5. The game is over if the bird crashes into a pipe or the ground.
6. Click the restart button to play again after the game ends.

## Game Mechanics
- **Flying**: The bird is affected by gravity and will descend unless the player clicks to make it flap upwards.
- **Obstacles**: Pipes appear at random heights and move towards the left side of the screen. The bird must fly through the gaps between them.
- **Collision Detection**: If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game is over.
- **Score Tracking**: The player's score increases by 1 each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes.

## Future Improvements
- Adding difficulty levels where the speed increases over time.
- Introducing sound effects for jumping, scoring, and crashing.
- Implementing different bird skins and pipe designs for a more personalized experience.
